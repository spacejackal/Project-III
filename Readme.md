# Pursue-Escape Planning Algorithm Development

## Overview

This project extends Project-II with probabilistic transitions. For any given action of an agent, and for any predefined proability distribution [p1, p2, p3], one has p1 probability of "rotating" the desired action to its left by 90-degree, and p3 probability of "rotating" the desreid action to its right by 90-degree, and p2 probability of keeping the desired action as it stands.

All other requirements remain consistent with Project-II, unless specified otherwise in the lectures.
